# Alfido-Tech-Internship-Task2
OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a housing dataset to understand the distribution and patterns of real estate features such as price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, living space, lot size, and property conditions. This analysis helps identify trends and insights that support better decision-making or future model development.

Key Activities:

Loading and preparing the dataset using Python and Pandas.

Converting date values into proper datetime format.

Plotting histograms for each key feature using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Customizing bin sizes and axis formatting for better visual clarity.

Analyzing the distributions to observe trends such as common house sizes, pricing, and property features like waterfront or view.

Modules Used:

Python: Core language for implementation.

Pandas: For data loading and manipulation.

NumPy: For numerical support.

Matplotlib: For plotting and customization of graphs.

Seaborn: For advanced and styled data visualizations.

Datetime: For converting and formatting date-related data.
